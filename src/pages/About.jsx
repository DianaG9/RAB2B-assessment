            <h5>Hi team at RaB2B!</h5>
            <p>I really hope you liked this project. I want to give you some context on what I did here:</p>
            <p>
                I created a creative portfolio using React and React Three Fiber for the "Home" page. This allows me to upload a 3D model and interact with it, showcasing my interest in interactive elements. Additionally, I added a toggle for Dark Mode functionality and used animated transitions to highlight other interactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                This portfolio showcases three projects in a carousel, each containing the title, an image, a description, and a link to my main portfolio, which was the main part of this assessment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I really enjoyed working on this project, and I hope we can work together!
            </p>
