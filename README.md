Hi team in RAB2B! 

I'm Diana and this is my assessment for the Front End Developer role position. I'm really excited about the role and wanted to showcase big part of my abilities.

To run the project you'll need to install the following: 

sass
react-router-dom
--save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/react-fontawesome  @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons 
three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
uuid
bootstrap
